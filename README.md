# CommitCV - V3

V3 of CommitCV is a complete rewrite of CommitCV, taking it from a 24-hour
vibe-coded hackathon program to a well-planned, smooth, & robust application
that you can trust to manage your resume (and hopefully more!).

## What's New?

- Local-first Typst Web Assembly Compiler
    - This means more more slow, server-compiled tex to render and download
      your resume
- Version contorl with git integration
- Standardized UI, Components, Fonts, etc.
- Human-authored-only Code
- Infrastructure moved to Vite + React + TailwindCSS V4
